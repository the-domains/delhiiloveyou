**What if we looked at Delhi with new eyes? **  
It's time to focus on what makes Delhi a city worth celebrating: its initiatives, its creativity, its history, its food, its stories, and its people.   
This video -**_A day in Delhi_**- is call to the citizens of Delhi to really feel their city,  to be proud of where they live, and to join the_**Delhi, I Love You**_movement. The video tries to capture the many souls that make up the city of Delhi, telling us their stories without saying a word.
